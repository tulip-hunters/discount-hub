# Project 2: Full-stack Web Application
**Web Application created by Senem Osmanova and Bartosz Dubinski as a part of Full-stack Web Developer Bootcamp in Ironhack**

### Technical Requirements
1. Use Express as a foundation.
2. Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
2. Have 2 models or more. Having one for users is a no-brainer. The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app. Don’t force it if having more than two models doesn’t make sense.
3. Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
4. Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
4. Implement all CRUD actions on models other than users. You should have the Create, Read, Update and Delete features even if they aren’t all for the same model.
6. Have a repo on GitHub.
7. Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on.
8. Be deployed online using Heroku so that anybody could use your app.
9. Responsive design is not a requirement, but it’s nice to have.
